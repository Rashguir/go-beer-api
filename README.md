Go Beer API
===========

A simple API based on a json file containing [those data](https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/open-beer-database%40public-us/table/).

This simple API only provides 2 routes as of today :

- `GET /beers` allows you to get all the beers without pagination
- `GET /beers/:id` allows you to get one beer per ID
